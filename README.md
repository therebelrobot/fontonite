# [Fontonite](http://therebelrobot.github.io/fontonite)
A public API to convert TTF and OTF fonts to Web Fonts

## Contributions
To contribute to the api, take a look at the [fontonite-server](https://github.com/therebelrobot/fontonite-server) repo.

To contribute, fork the repo, clone it locally, and when ready, install the dev dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run a simple http server by running the following:

```bash
npm start
```

Once you've made the desired changes, open a PR and I'll take a look at it.
